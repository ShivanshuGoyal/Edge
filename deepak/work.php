	<p>Supervised by <a href="http://www.geosci.usyd.edu.au/people/st_muller.shtml" style='text-decoration: none'>Prof. Dietmar Muller</a> and John Cannon, I am working towards developing modules for GPlates, a software that offers novel combination  of interactive plate-tectonic reconstructions, geographic information system (GIS) functionality and raster data visualisation. My work involves making it possible to view the geological output of Petrel software on GPlates screen, so that the evolution of hydrocarbon basin can be related with the movement of plates. Major part of this work will probably be completed during a 7-8 weeks’ vacation project at the EarthByte Group, during Dec, 2012-Jan, 2013.</p>

	</br></br><h5>Master's Thesis: Soft Computing for Intelligent Interpretation of Petroleum Data and Characterization of Reservoirs </h5>
	<p> <a href="http://www.ismdhanbad.ac.in/depart/geophysics/faculty.htm#7" style='text-decoration: none'>Dr. Rima Chatterjee</a> is supervising me in writing my Master's thesis. It involves the application of various intelligent and soft computing techniques in solving the problems concerned to the handling of seismic and welldata of Netherlands Offshore F3 block (courtesy Opendtect OSR). The project mainly focuses on using global optimization techniques such as ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm and some statistical methods. Some of the few challenges that are being handled in this work are 1) automated correlation of wells and genetic modelling 2) generation of pseudo-logs and interpolation of incomplete logs 3) producing efficient attribute cubes from seismic and well data and using them to mark the geological features. </p>

	</br><h5>Vacation Trainee at Schlumberger Asia Services Ltd. (June 04, 2012 to July 15, 2012) </h5>
	<p> My internship involved working under the SIS INM segment. I had worked on Petrel software of Schlumberger and was involved in development of plugins using C# and Ocean SDK. My plugins targeted towards handling few of the current challenges faced by oil and gas industry.  I was working at the ONGC Innovation Centre, ONGC Dehradun. I was supervised by Mr. B. S. Bisht (DGM, Wells ONGC), Dr. A. K. Nagar (Manager, Reservoir ONGC) and Sayani Kumar (Geoscientist, SIS). The problem statements were provided by ONGC. These problems mainly focused on using mathematical and statistical techniques to automate the process of well correlation and genetic modelling.First, I needed to develop suitable algorithms to solve these problems and once these algorithms were established, they needed to be incorporated into Petrel in the form of plugins. These plugins were develop in C# using Ocean SDK and .NET framework.</p>

	</br><h5> Project: Application of Rock Physics Models for determination of reservoir properties of three wells drilled during NHGP-01 Exp. in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) Basin, India (June, 2011 to March, 2012 at National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad) </h5>
	<p> <b>Title:</b> Summer Research Fellow and Distance Student Researcher
</br><b>Supervisor:</b> Dr. Kalachand Sain (Principal Scientist) and Dr. Uma Shankar (Senior Scientist)
</br><b>Brief Description:</b> This work is a sum total of work carried out as a summer research fellow and as a distance researcher.The summer vacation project involved estimating the saturation of gas hydrate and free gas at the three wells of KG Basin  drilled during NGHP-01 Expedition using various rock physics models. Further, based on previous models we have proposed a generalized rock physics model  which produces better results in this case. In addition, we have used various mathematical techniques to speed up the process of characterization of hydrate  reservoirs. Parts of this work have been presented at few international conferences and submitted to journals.
